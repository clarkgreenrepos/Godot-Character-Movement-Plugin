# Godot-Character-Movement-Plugin
This plugin provides a highly-configurable, production-ready first-person and third-person CharacterBody3D controller for Godot 4. It is built around responsive movement, grounded physics, and modern FPS mobility techniques inspired by Source/Quake-style movement systems.
